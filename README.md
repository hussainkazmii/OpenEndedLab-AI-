# OpenEndedLab-AI-
This is my Open Ended Lab (OEL) project in which we used a genetic algorithm in our meal planning problem. The user is required to set a target calorie count for their meal, and the genetic algorithm will provide them with the best possible combination of meals to fulfill their calorie goal.
